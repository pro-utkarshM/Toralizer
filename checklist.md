# Project Checklist: Rerouting Socket Connections through Tor Network

## 1. Prerequisites
- [ ] Install Tor on your Linux system
- [ ] Configure Tor SOCKS proxy on port 9050 in the `torrc` file
- [ ] Ensure `curl`, `SSH`, and other required tools are installed

## 2. Understand Core Concepts
- [ ] Study how Tor network works and how it anonymizes traffic
- [ ] Understand the basics of socket programming in Linux
- [ ] Learn about SOCKS proxies and their role in traffic routing
- [ ] Get familiar with the `LD_PRELOAD` technique for overriding system functions

## 3. Develop Custom Socket Function
- [ ] Write the custom `connect()` function to replace the default system call
- [ ] Implement logic to reroute connections through Tor’s SOCKS proxy
- [ ] Ensure the custom function persists only for the tool’s session

## 4. Testing and Debugging
- [ ] Test with `curl` to verify IP masking through Tor
- [ ] Test with `SSH` to ensure the connection is routed correctly
- [ ] Use `strace` to monitor system calls and validate the overridden `connect()` function
- [ ] Use `tcpdump` to analyze network traffic and verify Tor routing

## 5. Error Handling
- [ ] Implement error handling for failed socket connections
- [ ] Ensure fallback behavior if Tor connection fails
- [ ] Handle edge cases, such as improper tool usage or invalid Tor configurations

## 6. Security and Privacy
- [ ] Review the security implications of rerouting traffic through Tor
- [ ] Ensure proper handling of sensitive data during the connection
- [ ] Address any privacy concerns related to using Tor

## 7. Final Steps
- [ ] Document the code and provide clear instructions for users
- [ ] Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) for project updates
- [ ] Test on different Linux distributions for compatibility
- [ ] Follow updates on Tor and the project for ongoing improvements
